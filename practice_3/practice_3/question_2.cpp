Question 2. Heap Sort
Let's implement the heap sort. A = [4, 1, 3, 2, 16, 9, 10, 14, 8, 7]
Problem 1. heap construction
1)Draw the complete binary tree for each step (use the second algorithm learned at the lecture)
2)Implement thid and print the heap in code.

Problem 2. heap sort utilizing the heap
1)Draw the complete binary tree for each step (use the second algorithm learend at the lecture)
2)Implement this and print the sorted values int the code.
